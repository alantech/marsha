# Simple REST servers

<!-- - virtual env -->

<!-- - Install marsha -->

<!-- - set openai key -->

<!-- - Define the marsha file. The various function names become `/func_name` endpoints that you can POST to and get a response body back. If the function do not have parameters then you can use GET for that `/func_name` endpoint. -->

<!-- - Execute marsha -->

<!-- - Run generated script as web server in the desired port. If any of your functions takes multiple arguments, it *must* be called in JSON mode with the arguments each being an element of a top-level array. -->

<!-- - Use your webserver. If you set the `Content-Type` header to `application/json` the input and output will be JSON, if not it will be plain text. -->
