# func cnn(string of section to take headlines from): list of headlines

This function scrapes the cnn.com website for headlines. The section it takes the headlines from is passed to it, with 'home' referring to the homepage at cnn.com and should be special cased, while 'us' refers to cnn.com/us, 'politics' refers to cnn.com/politics, and so on for every top-level category CNN has.

Headlines on cnn.com have the class 'container__headline', no other class name correctly identifies them as the website has changed.
